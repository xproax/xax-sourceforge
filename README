This snapshot is for developers and very experienced users only.  It
is not functionally complete yet, and there are likely many rough
edges.  There's no upgrade path from 0.7 to 8.x, yet.

The GUI should behave basically the same as 0.7's GUI, but there are
some differences.

To build the system (experts only):

Native builds on amd64 and i386 work.  You can build i386 binaries
on a FreeBSD/amd64 system by setting FREENAS_ARCH=i386 in your
environment.

To build the system:

(1) Checkout the experimental code from svn:

% svn co https://freenas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freenas/trunk
% cd trunk

(2) Use the build script (substituting your favorite cvsup mirror)

% sudo env FREEBSD_CVSUP_HOST=cvsup10.freebsd.org sh build/do_build.sh
% sudo sh build/create_iso.sh

That's it. When updating source patches and/or ports, you may need to
some additional steps by hand.  The above is known to work on FreeBSD
8.1-RELEASE and newer.

Once (2) completes, you'll have an image in
obj.yyyy/FreeNAS-8rXXXX-yyyy.full where XXXX is the svn revision from
the freenas repo, and yyyy is either i386 or amd64 depending on your
platform.  This is a raw disk image, and needs to be converted to your
favorite VM container format before use...  Alternatively, there will
also be a obj.yyy/FreeNAS-8rXXXX-yyyy.full.iso that contains an ISO
image that you can use to install FreeNAS with.
