Release Notes for FreeNAS 8.2-RELEASE

*** IMPORTANT ***

The image size increased in 8.0.1-BETA3.  The new size requires a 2 GB
storage device.  The GUI upgrade can be used to upgrade a system from BETA3, 
BETA4, or RC1 but upgrades from earlier releases can only be done from the CD.
The other option is to save the config, reinstall the new version, then
restore the config.

Changes since 8.0.3-[...]:

Enhancements:

1. FreeBSD:

a. CSUP snapshot used in build updated from 07/17/2011 to 11/15/2011 snapshot.

2. GUI:

a. dojango updated to 1.7.1.

3. NAS middleware:

a. Changes to ZFS volumes in FreeBSD CLI are now reflected in the GUI.
b. First draft plugin framework completed.

Bugfixes:



Changes since 8.0.2-RELEASE:

Enhancements:

1. Reduce FreeNAS footprint:

a. Use smaller block and frag sizes for /etc and /var .
b. Import a build tweak to nuke /var/db/pkg to save ~7MB space.
c. Other build tweaks to remove non-essential features and packages from the image.

2. NAS middleware:

a. Hide Etc/GMT* timezones as they're behavior is counterintuitive and conflicts with Windows 7 semantics (see r8707).
b. Add tunable / sysctl support.

3. AD/CIFS:

a. Bump samba from 3.5.11 to 3.6.1.

4. AFP:

a. Bump netatalk to 2.2.1.
b. Add knob for controlling the maximum number of configurable connections (see ticket: 847).
c. Only advertise services via avahi if they're enabled (see ticket: 852).

5. Rsync:

a. NFSv4 ACL support (see: r8375, r8414).

6. Misc:

a. Upgrade ataidle

Bugfixes:

1. Rsync task/crontab generation was broken with AD usernames and other unsanitized input.
2. ZFS volume deletion failed when trying to delete zvol with the name 'zvol'.
3. SSH pubkey saving was broken unless you manually add a newline to the text box.
4. Fix email regressions since 8.0.2-RELEASE-p1 (SMART emails now work with more than one recipient, non-SMTP authentication based emails work again).
5. Fix traceback when trying to edit user if ssh public key was not specified.
6. Address simple failure cases with getting Kerberos tickets (clock skew) and joining AD domains so that users could better rectify improperly configured NAS boxes; this means that if either of these cases fail, the GUI will now feed back that the 'Active Directory' service is stopped.
7. Fix the bug in rsync tasks where it would strip the trailing '/' off the end of the destination path.
8. Fix a validation error when editing users / groups in 8.0.2+ where if one entered in a path that wasn't valid, the GUI would traceback instead of punting the actual validation error.

Cosmetic items:

1. Change "SSH key" in GUI to "SSH Public Key".
2. Fix GUI trademarks and branding to be more consistent with proper branding, similar to what TrueNAS does today.

Major changes since 8.0.1-RELEASE:

- The email subsystem was not working correctly in 8.0.1-RELEASE, which
  resulted in the system not being able to send mail, as well as disfunction
  of the alerting system in the GUI.

Changes since 8.0.1-RELEASE:

- Allow decimal numbers for a dataset quota. (r8728)

- Fix setting recursive ACLs. (r8270)

- Start proftpd after ix-ssl to use the correct SSL cert. (r8246)

- Use wildcards in cron and rsync jobs instead of listing all values. (r8214, r8211)

- Fix case in iSCSI targets to match the behavior specified by RFC 3722. (r8120)

Changes since 8.0-RELEASE:

There's too much to list here, but the high points are:

- Divorced the volume members in the database from the FreeBSD devices.
  This resolves an issue where FreeBSD can change devices names and the
  GUI doesn't pick up the updates due to the devices names being hard-wired
  in the database.

- Support exporting ZFS zvols (virtual devices) as device extents via iSCSI.
  8.0 was only able to export physical device nodes or file based extents.

- The GUI now has an event notification system.

- The email backend has been refactored.

- Many many changes in the GUI to help it validate and sanitize inputs that
  are passed to the backend daemons.

- Added UPS functionality.

- Added rsync client and server functionality.

- Added the ability to schedule cron jobs in the GUI.

- Vastly improved and reworked snapshot replication.

Errata:

CHAP doesn't work with GlobalSAN initiators on OS X.

Upgrades from FreeNAS 0.7 aren't supported.

The installer doesn't check the size of the install media before attempting
an install.  A 2 GB device is required, but the install will appear to
complete successfully on smaller devices, only to fail at boot.

The installer will let you switch from i386 to amd64 architecture and
vice-versa, but some files, such as the rrd files used by the statistics
graphing package are architecture dependent.
