Release Notes for FreeNAS 8.0.3-RELEASE-p1

*** IMPORTANT ***

- The image size increased in 8.0.1-BETA3.  The new size requires a 2 GB
  storage device.  The GUI upgrade can be used to upgrade a system from
  BETA3, BETA4, or RC1 but upgrades from earlier releases can only be
  done from the CD. The other option is to save the config, reinstall
  the new version, then restore the config.
- FreeBSD can be really touchy with hardware. Please be sure to update
  your BIOS/BMC firmware when upgrading / installing FreeNAS if you run
  into OS hang issues. There have been cases identified where a BIOS
  upgrade has fixed driver hangs, and/or other issues with FreeNAS; one
  such example was with an Intel 82578DC motherboard, as noted in the
  FreeNAS 8 forum thread titled "8.0.3-RELEASE coming soon..":
  http://bit.ly/rq78Q3 , post # 70-88. Again, please only do this if you
  experience booting / runtime issues, as some vendors don't test
  FreeBSD interoperability as much as others between major firmware
  releases.
- Previous builds were branded as i386/amd64 (32-bit and 64-bit
  respectively). 8.0.3-RC1+ rebranded the architectures as x86 and x64,
  respectively.
- 8.0.1 and 8.0.2 images advertised CIFS shares to Macs by default but
  8.0.3 and later images don't advertise CIFS shares by default. If you
  want to advertise CIFS shares in 8.0.3 and later, be sure to turn on
  "Zeroconf" support in the CIFS global settings.
- Builds prior to 8.0.3-RELEASE with 'CIFS' didn't actually have AIO
  (asynchronous I/O) enabled. So, if you experience performance
  degradation after upgrading from prior versions of FreeNAS to
  8.0.3-RELEASE or newer, turn off AIO or tune the AIO size from '1' to
  something more reasonable (the new default in 8.0.3-RELEASE-p1 is 4096
  or 4kB).


Changes since 8.0.4-BETA2:

Enhancements
========================

Build
------------------------

1. Remove Full_Install from the compressed disk image name to avoid
   potential confusion when looking at the disk image vs the GUI
   upgrade image (SF r10154).

Middleware
------------------------

1. Do not restart collectd (reporting backend) when deleting snapshots
   in the GUI (SF r10139).

Tools
------------------------

1. Add arcstat.py and arc_summary.py tools originally contributed by
   jhell (FreeBSD contributor), ported by jhixson to FreeNAS 8.x.

Bugfixes
========================

GUI
------------------------

1. Correct window title for snapshot deletion GUI (SF r10138).

Middleware
------------------------

1. Catch ZFS snapshot errors when snapshots are done via the GUI instead of
   failing silently (SF r10152).
2. Work around interoperability issues with user / group population in the
   GUI by failing silently in certain cases if AD/LDAP users cannot be
   retrieved (SF r10140).
3. Fix case where local and remote paths passed to rsync in Rsync tasks
   weren't quoted, so paths with spaces in them would not work (FN 1285).


Changes since 8.0.4-BETA1:

Enhancements
========================

OS/Third party
------------------------

1. Update transmission to 2.42 (SF r10093).
2. Add MegaCLI tool (SF r10072, r10073).
3. Disable periodic tasks in the base system that would negatively
   impact system performance on NAS boxes with large directory
   structures (SF r10113).

Bugfixes
========================

Middleware
------------------------

1. Fix handling for 'every day' SMART tasks created in the GUI
   (SF r10088).
2. Add in several robustness fixes to reduce potential for filesystem
   corruption on root / boot device. In some scenarios this would also
   improve performance when fetching data from the root device as well
   (SF r10095, r10109, r10129).

CIFS
------------------------
1. Fix vfs objects modules ordering so shadow copy (aka previous
   versions) support functions again (FN 935, FN 1186, FN 1275).
2. Update samba to 3.6.3 to resolve several bugs (both security and
   non-security related) (SF r10127).

iSCSI
------------------------

1. Network field from iSCSI initiator could contain multiple IP
   addresses, CIDR addresses, or ANY keyword (SF r10082).
2. Generate istgt.conf properly if and when multiple initiators were
   specified (SF r10081).


Changes since 8.0.3-RELEASE-p1:

Enhancements
========================

Build
------------------------
1. Add .img suffix to simplify mounting full disk image for Windows and
   OSX users (FN # 1236).

OS/Third party
------------------------

1. Update firefly to 1696_6 for iTunes 10.5.2+ compatibility.
2. Add in sane caps for minimum ZFS requirements for lower spec'ed home
   user machines.

AD/CIFS
------------------------

1. Automatically create AD/LDAP user home directories (FN # 1203).
2. Add 'allow trusted domains' knob in the CIFS global configuration
   (FN # 998).

iSCSI
------------------------

1. Restrict portal input in the GUI to prevent scenarios where
   incorrect input would prevent iSCSI from starting (FN # 1231).

Rsync
------------------------

1. Add rsync+SSH functionality (FN # 990).
2. Add functionality to differentiate rsync pushing from pulling
   (FN # 394).

Bugfixes
========================

GUI
------------------------

1. Fix disks / partition parsing when importing volumes (FN # 1202).
2. Restrict users from creating cronjobs / rsync tasks with long
   usernames (FN # 1061).

Middleware
------------------------

1. Correct smbpasswd parsing when debug level isn't set to minimum
   logging (FN # 1224).

AD/CIFS
------------------------

1. Escape samba AD/LDAP passwords (FN # 1225).
2. Ensure guest accounts are disabled if checked (SF r8276).


Changes since 8.0.3-RELEASE:

Enhancements
------------------------

OS/Third party
========================

1. Update ataidle from 2.6 to 2.72 based on maintainer's (brucec@FreeBSD)
   recommendation due to interoperabilities with 2.6 and certain chipsets.
2. Fix the inadyn port so that it works on i386.

Bugfixes
------------------------

Middleware
========================
1. Fix a regression for DHCP users where /etc/resolv.conf would be nulled
   out if DNS servers weren't specified in the GUI.

AD/CIFS
========================
1. Disable AIO by default and change the default AIO read / write size to
   4kB. This was done provided feedback and the fact that the build fixes
   actually enabled AIO, whereas prior releases didn't enable it by
   default. This can cause issues with machines that don't have the
   resources to service AIO requests quickly enough, where previously they
   would be able to service requests at near line speeds, whereas after
   they are unable to service requests that quickly.

NFS:
========================
1. Add in logic to start lockd and mountd when NFS is enabled s.t. FreeNAS
   doesn't need to be manually prodded to start the services, or rebooted
   in order for the services to become effective.

Changes since 8.0.2-RELEASE:

Enhancements
------------------------

OS/Third party
========================

1. Use smaller block and frag sizes for /etc and /var .
2. Import a build tweak to nuke /var/db/pkg to save ~7MB space.
3. Other build tweaks to remove non-essential features and packages from
   the image.
4. Disable output to /var/log/console.log in non-debug builds to avoid
   unnecessary duplication in /var/log/messages .
5. Upgrade ataidle to 2.6.
6. Upgrade nut / net-snmp to 2.6.2 and 5.7.1, respectively.
7. Import omnibus build system fixes to fix the fact that the 8.0.3-BETA1
   image was broken due to the environment of the build machine where it
   was produced on. This also fixes other items, such as DDNS because of
   build environment tainting.
8. Increase the /var md size from 74MB to 160MB s.t. samba will be able
   to service requests copying large sets of files, and the rest of the
   system will be able to play nicely with samba to a certain degree.
   More tuning is required for larger samba userbases.

GUI
========================

1. Add kernel tunable / sysctl support.

Middleware
========================

1. Hide Etc/GMT* timezones as they're behavior is counterintuitive and
   conflicts with Windows 7 semantics (see r8707).

AD/CIFS
========================

1. Bump samba from 3.5.11 to 3.6.1.
2. Address simple failure cases with getting Kerberos tickets (clock
   skew) and joining AD domains (invalid passwords, bad short domain names,
   etc) so that users could better rectify improperly configured NAS boxes;
   this means that if either of these cases fail, the GUI will now inform
   the user that the 'Active Directory' service is stopped.
3. Fix cachetool to better prevent potential race condition at boot between
   winbindd and ix-cache.
4. Add knob for enabling/disabling Zeroconf/Bonjour (avahi) support in the
   GUI. For technical reasons outside of the author's control, this
   feature defaults to off when upgrading FreeNAS. FreeNAS admins
   anticipating that they will have Mac users attempting to connect to CIFS
   shares should enable this feature.

AFP
========================

1. Bump netatalk to 2.2.1.
2. Add knob for controlling the maximum number of configurable connections
   (see ticket: 847).
3. Only advertise services via avahi if they're enabled (see ticket: 852).

Rsync
========================

- NFSv4 ACL support (see: r8375, r8414).

Bugfixes
------------------------

OS/Third party
========================

1. Fix NTFS volume imports.

GUI
========================

1. ZFS volume deletion failed when trying to delete zvol with the name
   'zvol'.
2. SSH pubkey saving was broken unless you manually add a newline to the
   text box.
3. Fix traceback when trying to edit user if ssh public key was not
   specified.
4. Fix the bug in rsync tasks where it would strip the trailing '/' off
   the end of the destination path.
5. Fix a validation error when editing users / groups in 8.0.2+ where
   if one entered in a path that wasn't valid, the GUI would traceback
   instead of punting the actual validation error.
6. Fix an issue where if one entered in an invalid path, the GUI would
   traceback instead of providing feedback stating that the directory
   provided was invalid.

Middleware
========================

1. Rsync task/crontab generation was broken with AD usernames and other
   unsanitized input.
2. Fix email regressions since 8.0.2-RELEASE-p1 (SMART emails now work
   with more than one recipient, non-SMTP authentication based emails
   work again).
4. Fix an issue where if one autosnap process was killed uncleanly, more
   autosnap processes could back up and eventually deadlock the system.
5. Fix an issue where the ZFS scrub cronjobs would execute every 30 days
   instead of a number divisible by 7, so what would generally happen is
   that ZFS scrubs would generally execute in the middle of the week.
6. Fix setting httpd to listen on an interface which is not the first
   interface.
7. Add logic to create home directories on demand instead of failing
   'silently' if the path to the directory didn't already exist.
8. Fix 'detaching' NTFS/UFS volumes so that it unmounts the volume in
   the FreeBSD backend.

AD/CIFS
========================

1. Change the default workgroup from FREENAS to WORKGROUP as having the same
   name for the workgroup and the hostname is illegal per the SMB/CIFS
   protocol.

Cosmetic items
------------------------

1. Change "SSH key" in GUI to "SSH Public Key".
2. Fix GUI trademarks and branding to be more consistent with proper
   branding, similar to what TrueNAS does today.



Major changes since 8.0.1-RELEASE:

- The email subsystem was not working correctly in 8.0.1-RELEASE, which
  resulted in the system not being able to send mail, as well as of the
  alerting system in the GUI.

Changes since 8.0.1-RELEASE:

- Allow decimal numbers for a dataset quota. (r8728)

- Fix setting recursive ACLs. (r8270)

- Start proftpd after ix-ssl to use the correct SSL cert. (r8246)

- Use wildcards in cron and rsync jobs instead of listing all values. (r8214, r8211)

- Fix case in iSCSI targets to match the behavior specified by RFC 3722. (r8120)

Changes since 8.0-RELEASE:

There's too much to list here, but the high points are:

- Divorced the volume members in the database from the FreeBSD devices.
  This resolves an issue where FreeBSD can change devices names and the
  GUI doesn't pick up the updates due to the devices names being hard-wired
  in the database.

- Support exporting ZFS zvols (virtual devices) as device extents via iSCSI.
  8.0 was only able to export physical device nodes or file based extents.

- The GUI now has an event notification system.

- The email backend has been refactored.

- Many many changes in the GUI to help it validate and sanitize inputs that
  are passed to the backend daemons.

- Added UPS functionality.

- Added rsync client and server functionality.

- Added the ability to schedule cron jobs in the GUI.

- Vastly improved and reworked snapshot replication.

Errata:

- CHAP doesn't work with GlobalSAN initiators on OS X.

- Upgrades from FreeNAS 0.7 aren't supported.

- The installer doesn't check the size of the install media before attempting
  an install.  A 2 GB device is required, but the install will appear to
  complete successfully on smaller devices, only to fail at boot.

- The installer will let you switch from i386 to amd64 architecture and
  vice-versa, but some files, such as the rrd files used by the statistics
  graphing package are architecture dependent.

- There are known interoperability issues with FreeNAS and Samba 4.x being
  used as a PDC due to Samba 4.x not conforming to the Microsoft CIFS
  specification and the way LDAP queries are executed on FreeNAS. Please see
  the following support ticket for more details:
  http://support.freenas.org/ticket/1135 .

- Shadow copies via CIFS do not work in 8.0.3. Please see
  https://support.freenas.org/ticket/1186 for more details.
